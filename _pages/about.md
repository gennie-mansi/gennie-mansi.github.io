I’m a 5th year Human-Centered PhD Candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I work with Mark Riedl.


I'm computer scientist and human-centered design researcher passionate about collaborating with algorithm developers to improve communities’ interactions with technology. I draw on my interdisciplinary background to dig deeper into the who, why, and how of creating technology to help people do what they want to do. Through intentional study design and rigorous qualitative analysis, I’ve brought concrete insights for projects in explainable AI systems, education technology, and reinforcement learning agents. 

In my dissertation, I’ve created a user-centered taxonomy which clarifies the connection between the information present in an AI explanation and users’ resulting actions. My research is creating a clear path for developers to design, create, and evaluate AI explanations, so users can meet their core needs.
