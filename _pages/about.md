I’m a 5th year Human-Centered Computing PhD Candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I work with Dr. Mark Riedl. My research focuses on bridging gaps between AI developers and practitioners to improve the design of AI systems in high-stakes domains. My dissertation creates and applies a user-centered taxonomy to improve the way AI explanations are designed, created, and evaluated. As a part of this work, I’m coordinating design between lawyers, developers, and doctors to create AI explanations that address doctors’ legal risks. Outside of my dissertation, I have worked on projects in education to empower teachers in engaging with their students.
